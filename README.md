## What Does a Delphix Plugin Do?
Delphix is a data management platform that provides the ability to securely copy and share datasets. Using virtualization, you will ingest your data sources and create virtual data copies, which are full read-write capable database instances that use a small fraction of the resources a normal database copy would require. The Delphix engine has built-in support for interfacing with certain types of datasets, such as Oracle, SQL Server and ASE.

The Delphix virtualization SDK (https://github.com/delphix/virtualization-sdk) provides an interface for building custom data source integrations for the Delphix Dynamic Data Platform. The end users can design/implement a custom plugin which enable them to use custom data source like MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase or something else similar to as if they are using a built-in dataset type with Delphix Engine.

## About Couchbase Plugin:
Couchbase plugin is developed to virtualize couchbase data source leveraging the following built-in couchbase technologies:
  - Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR) allows data to be replicated across clusters that are potentially located in different data centers.
  - Cbbackupmgr allows data to be restored on staging host of Couchbase Server. 
  - Ingest Couchbase: Dsource can be created from a Couchbase cluster/single instance using (XDCR ingestion mechanism) or 
                    : Dsource can be created by restoring from a Couchbase backup peice using (CBBACKUPMGR ingestion mechanism) - Zero Touch Production.
  - Environment Discovery: Couchbase plugin can discover environments where Couchbase server is installed.
  - VDB Creation: Single node Couchbase VDB can be provisioned from the dsource snapshot.
