# This is interface which must be included by all child class of Resource
# This is child class of Resource and parent class of CouchbaseOperation
# Therefore child class has to implement the method generate_environment_map
# Mixin class(Class which is implementing this interface) created only in two cases:
#   1-> Bunch of methods belonging to one group
#   2-> Environment data is common for all the commands
# For case #1, it's about practice we should follow in software development
# For case #2, if such kind of cases are there in which common env data is required in execution of multiple commands
# then we club them in one class. Implement 'generate_environment_map' method and let it used by all methods defined in
# class.
# Other benefits are: Can call read_map to read each env data, Handling of attribute error while generating the env data
